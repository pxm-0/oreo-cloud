# Oreo Cloud P0 Package

This package is the P0 handoff for building **Oreo Cloud**: a private, Git-tracked, personal ECS-style control plane for `oreochiserver`.

P0 is not a public hosting platform. P0 is the minimum safe foundation:

- one private dashboard reachable from phone/laptop over Tailscale
- Git-tracked platform configuration
- neutral workload registry
- dashboard-visible privacy and access states
- authenticated dashboard toggles for privacy and desired access
- read-only workload health/status commands
- btop-style monitoring panel behind a dashboard toggle
- workload migration planning into `/srv/oreo-cloud/workloads/<id>`
- Cloudflare exposure planning, disabled by default
- no public exposure unless a future task explicitly enables it

## P0 North Star

From a phone on Tailscale, open:

```text
http://oreochiserver:8088
```

See all workloads, health, routes, privacy state, desired access state, effective access state, and a toggleable monitor panel.

Admin mode can change privacy and desired access, but P0 should only apply safe states automatically. Cloudflare exposure remains planned/provisioned, not live, unless explicitly enabled in a later phase.
